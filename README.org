* Joker Mode

A simple derived mode for [[https://github.com/candid82/joker][joker]] scripts.

The raison d'Ãªtre of this package is simply easier configuration and separation
from clojure-mode specific tools like CIDER.

** Using [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure][inf-clojure]]:

Set the inferior lisp command:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-local inf-clojure-generic-cmd "joker")
#+END_SRC
